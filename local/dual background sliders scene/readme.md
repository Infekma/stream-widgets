(NOTE: slightly jitter due to frame rates)

= Setup:
* Create a folder.. i.e. "Stream Intro Screen"
* extract contents to that folder
* create browser source and set the index.html as the source
* set the browser source size to a reasonable size.. 720p or something (or if you use a specific resolution for all images use that)
* done..

= Configuration:
* everything can be found in config.js (open with notepad)
* i.e. change images inside the imageList (follow that syntaxing)


= Notes
* Small images will get stretched to fit the window so they'll appear more blurry but if you use more reasonably sized images it'll be fine.
* Best quality in images is to match the browser source resolution to the image resolution, you can play with different sizes to see the quality ðŸ˜›

If you end up using it and spot any issues let me know.

again see config.js for further configuration options!
